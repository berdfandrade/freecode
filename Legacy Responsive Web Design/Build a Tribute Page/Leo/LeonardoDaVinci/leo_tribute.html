        <ul>
    
          <li><strong>1452</strong> - Leonardo was born to Ser Piero, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant girl; his parents were never married. </li>
          <li>

            <strong>1467</strong> - Lorenzo and Giuliano de Medici become new rulers of Florence. The two brothers took over when their father died.
